# Feature Spec: City Simulation Core

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Draft
**Author**: Kilo Code
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

## 1. Overview & Context

This document outlines the core requirements for a comprehensive city simulation model. The primary goal is to develop a complex, interactive model of a city's lifecycle, encompassing its natural environment, infrastructure, social dynamics, and industrial sectors. The project will be developed in C# using WPF for the user interface, targeting .NET 9. The development process must adhere to OOP principles and the MVVM pattern.

## 2. User Scenarios & Goals

### 2.1. As a Player/User, I want to:
-   Visually observe the city's development on a geographic map.
-   Manage the construction of different building types (residential, commercial, industrial).
-   Observe the life of citizens: their movement, employment, and education.
-   Monitor the city's transportation network and traffic flow.
-   Respond to dynamic events like natural disasters.
-   Manage the city's economy by developing various industrial and commercial sectors.
-   Save my progress and load it later.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### FR-MAP-01: Map Generation
- The system must generate a map with varied terrain, including mountains and water bodies.
- The map must display locations of natural resources like minerals and forests.

### FR-BLD-01: Construction
- The system must allow placing residential, commercial, and service buildings on the map.
- Each building type must have distinct characteristics and functions.

### FR-POP-01: Population Simulation
- The system must simulate individual citizens.
- Citizens must have properties like age, education level, and employment status.
- Citizens must be able to move around the city, find jobs, and attend educational institutions.

### FR-TRN-01: Transport System
- The system must support the creation of a road network.
- The system must simulate the movement of vehicles (cars, public transport) along the road network.

### FR-ECO-01: Economic and Industrial Simulation
- The system must model various production chains, from resource extraction to finished goods.
- The simulation must include multiple industrial sectors (e.g., mining, manufacturing, energy).
- The system must model commercial activities like retail and services.

### FR-EVT-01: Dynamic Events
- The system must simulate random events such as natural disasters (e.g., fires, floods).
- The system must include services to respond to these events (e.g., fire department).

### FR-UI-01: User Interface
- The UI must provide a clear visual representation of all simulated elements.
- The UI must include panels and tools for managing the city.
- The UI must allow for saving and loading the game state.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-PERF-01: Performance
- The simulation must run smoothly on a standard desktop computer, even with a large number of simulated objects.

### NFR-CODE-01: Code Quality
- The entire codebase must be well-documented, with comments for classes, methods, and complex logic.
- The project must follow OOP principles and the MVVM design pattern.

### NFR-DEVOPS-01: Development Process
- All work must be done in separate feature branches in a shared Git repository.
- Commits must be logical and descriptive.
- Code must be merged into the main branch only after successful testing.

## 5. Scope

### 5.1. In Scope:
-   Map generation with resources.
-   Building placement.
-   Basic population and transport simulation.
-   Multiple interconnected industrial and social sectors.
-   Save/Load functionality.
-   Graphical user interface using WPF.

### 5.2. Out of Scope (for initial version):
-   Multiplayer functionality.
-   Advanced 3D graphics (focus is on 2D/isometric representation).
-   Complex political or social simulation (e.g., elections, crime).

## 6. Key Entities & Data Model (Initial)

-   **GameMap**: Contains a grid of `Tiles`.
-   **Tile**: Represents a single cell on the map with properties like `TerrainType` and `NaturalResource`.
-   **Building**: Base class for all structures.
    -   `ResidentialBuilding`: Houses `Citizens`.
    -   `CommercialBuilding`: Provides jobs and goods.
    -   `ServiceBuilding`: Provides services like healthcare or education.
    -   `IndustrialBuilding`: Part of a production chain.
-   **Citizen**: An individual person with needs and a daily routine.
-   **Car**: A vehicle for transportation.
-   **NaturalResource**: A resource deposit on the map.

## 7. Assumptions

-   The project is a collaborative effort, and visual consistency is required.
-   Each student is responsible for a specific domain but must integrate it into the whole.
-   A detailed report and wiki documentation are mandatory deliverables.

## 8. Clarifications Needed

-   **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Visual Style]**: What is the agreed-upon visual style and color palette? The current preference is a minimalistic 2D/isometric style, but this requires final confirmation.
-   **Integration API**: Interaction between modules will be carried out through a set of shared interfaces defined within the `Core` project. This ensures a consistent and strongly-typed contract for services (e.g., `IMapService`, `IPopulationService`) and models. Direct service calls are permissible where appropriate, but dependency on interfaces is the preferred approach.
-   **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Economic Model]**: What is the core currency or economic model? How are prices and wages determined?
