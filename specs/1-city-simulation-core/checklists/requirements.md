# Specification Quality Checklist: City Simulation Core

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](specs/1-city-simulation-core/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Spec mentions C#/WPF/.NET9 as required by the prompt, but not in a way that dictates implementation choices within the spec itself.*
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [-] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - *Progress made, but 2 items still need clarification.*
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`. The spec currently contains 3 clarification requests that need to be addressed.
